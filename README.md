## Description

This directory provides code used for the computations associated with the quadratic optimization models in the context of undesirable facility location problems for the abovementioned article.

## Requirements to run code

The code uses the following open-source Python packages. 

Pyomo, a Python-based optimization modeling language that allows building optimization models.
Gurobi, a software well-equiped for solving complex optimization models such as MIQPs.
Geopy, which was used for calculating geodesic distances (i.e. shortest distances on the surface of the earth) between two locations.

## Results

Results are provided here.



## Ongoing Development

This code is being developed on an on-going basis at the authors'
[Github site]([https://github.com/tkralphs/JoCTemplate](https://github.com/schmitt-hub/preferential_access_and_fairness_in_waste_management)).
